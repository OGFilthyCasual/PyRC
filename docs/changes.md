* An extensive overhaul of GUI, its much more XChat or Textual now, less mIRC
* New command: /id <password>  Sends your password directly to NickServ, in lieu of using /msg
* New command: /statchan Reports the number of users on the current channel, may do more in the future
* Changed primary input widget to QLineEdit, updated InputFilter class to match
* Resolved some issues sending data to the server, (thanks Dash and Simpson freenode)
