##PyRC
An IRC client written in Python and Qt

This is a pet project, primarily so that I can teach myself Python.

This project was created shortly after I installed mIRC and realized that it was a trial version which would inevitably expire.  I decided that in my quest to learn Python I would write a functional replacement for mIRC before the trial expired.  Every line of code here is the embodiment of that effort.  I hope you enjoy.

This project was created with Komodo Edit 8, Qt Designer, and requires PyQt 4.8

#####Massive Update (2013-04-11)

The user interface has had a massive overhaul, I still have tonnes of work to do but the UI is much cleaner now.  The new layout was inspired by XChat and Textual.
