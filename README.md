This is a pet project, primarily so that I can teach myself Python.

I started developing in Python 2012-06-07.  This project was created 2012-06-29, shortly after I installed mIRC and realized that it was a trial version which would inevitably expire.  I decided that in my quest to learn Python I would write a functional replacement for mIRC before the trial expired 2012-07-15.  Every line of code here is the embodiment of that effort.  I hope you enjoy.

This project was created in and is best viewed with Monkey Studio.  Get a copy from http://monkeystudio.org/
